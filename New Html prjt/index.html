                <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.[2] Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April
                    7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns,
                    and inaccuracy while moving.</p>
